 USA.saf.war.missions.1.t:0 "The Fall of Windhoek"
 USA.saf.war.missions.1.desc:0 "Today, the Afrika-Schild suffers a serious blow. Despite constant aerial bombings from increasingly desperate defenders, the South African army, supported by elements of the OFN coalition, has taken Windhoek, administrative center of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika, after almost a day of furious fighting. The central compound of the colonial government was the last sector of the city to fall, as almost two hundred soldiers, supported by a battalion of the native SS, had bunkered in the heavily-fortified building, forcing the American troops to clear the underground corridors and booby-trapped halls with flamethrowers and military engineers.\n\nThe last weeks had seen the combined Allied troops inflicting defeat after defeat against the Reichskommissariat, steadily gaining ground against a weakened and demoralized opponent, but this might be the turning point for the war: with the fall of Windhoek, the Schild has lost its largest air fields, and large supplies fuel and airplane parts have been seized by the attackers before the Germans could retreat.\n\nReikscommissar Schenck has managed to flee the city on his personal fighter, and in his first statement he has sworn "to bring back the German flag to Windhoek ", but with the western front in disarray and Schild troops still retreating, many doubt whether he'll be able to keep faith to his word."
 USA.saf.war.missions.1.a:0 "And yet the war goes on."

 USA.saf.war.missions.2.t:0 "The Second Battle of Windhoek"
 USA.saf.war.missions.2.desc:0 "Many had thought that the loss of Windhoek and its airfields would spell the end of the Afrika-Schild and their battle for German supremacy in Africa. On the contrary, the defeat spurred the Reichskommissariaten to reorganize and react: after several days spent planning and concentrating troops and supplies, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte launched a general offensive on the occupied city. Troops from the entire coalition attacked with fierceness bordering desperation, and despite heavy losses managed to push the frontline until the South Africans and their American allies had to fall back to the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt was immediately evident how ill-prepared had been the defenders, as they never thought the Germans would actually be able to react to the last defeat. Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads. Rather than suffering heavy losses, the commander preferred to retreat from the city, and convoys filled with soldiers and supplies quickly left the cities the night before the attack.\n\nThe following day, the German troops entered the liberated Windhoek in triumph, though the locals seemed less than happy to welcome their saviors. Reichskommissar Schenck returned to the city hailed by his soldiers, and resumed his post in the administrative compound, now under heavy repairs. The victory has been broadcasted all the way to Germania, and reinvigorated the morale of the Afrika-Schild. On the contrary, South African sources appeared dismayed by the defeat, as it seems clear that the war will be much longer and bloodier than expected."

 USA.saf.war.missions.3.desc:0 "Perhaps the Boers should have prepared a little more for the civil war they started, and that has now degenerated into a proxy war for African supremacy between the Afrika-Schild and the OFN. Situated very close to the initial frontlines of the war, Bloemfontein, capital of the newly-established Boer Republic, had little time to prepare: despite the efforts of the garrison commander, lack of manpower and materials due to the poor industrial development of the region meant that only makeshift defences, mainly a few prefabricated bunkers, trenches and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the outskirts, could be erected in time for the South African offensive.\n\nDespite a fierce resistance, the city garrison couldn't repel the attackers and was soon forced to retreat inwards: emergency barricades were built by auxiliaries, and several buildings were booby-trapped or set on fire to slow down the foe, but in the end it wasn't enough. After a brief last stand in the town hall, the officer in command of the city agreed to the surrender terms offered by the Federation: the civilian irregulars were disarmed and allowed to return to their families, while all others were taken prisoners.\n\nEven though the government evacuated the city long before the offensive began, due to safety reasons, the fall of Bloemfontein is still a hard blow to take for the Boer cause. Morale is falling all throughout the insurgent forces, and many have begun to question their German allies: if this is how the war is turning out to be, then it may not be long before peace returns.

 USA.saf.war.missions.4.desc:0 "The fall of the Boer Republic's capital had been a very hard blow to the morale of the insurgent nation. Ever since that fateful day, they had worked hard to wash away the humiliation: thanks to German advisors and supplies, and with the decisive support of specialists from the Schild, a joint task force finally launched a concentrated offensive to retake Bloemfontein.\n\nHeavy bombing runs demolished the makeshift defences erected by the South Africans to deflect the counteroffensive, and Boer infantry, supported by german artillery and helicopter, stormed the now-silent defensive emplacements, forcing the garrison back just as the first defenders had been when the city fell the first time. In a strange mockery of time and human fortunes, the South African commander surrendered at the very table where his Boer predecessor had done the same thing.\n\nWith the liberation of Bloemfontein, the frontline has returned as it was at the start of the war, and many within South Africa are worried that the offensive might spill inside the country, forcing them to assume defensive positions to avoid further ground losses. Meanwhile, the Boers celebrate their hard-earned victory, and hope that this will be the first of many."

 USA.saf.war.missions.5.desc:0 "The newly-christened Johanasburg, formerly Johannesburg when the city was still part of the South African Federation, has been captured by advancing federal troops. As the war entered its acute phase, with German and American troops fighting each other directly, the Boers found themselves as the proverbial clay pot between the iron ones: the newly established Boer Republic was immediately invaded, and despite the trickle of supplies from the Schild, the Federation was able to break through the border defences and directly push for Johanasburg in their effort to force the insurgent state to capitulate.\n\nAs the second most populous city in all of South Africa, Johanasburg was heavily garrisoned and protected, but it proved to be too little to stop the advancing attackers: the fortifications were torn down by heavy bombings, which were immediately followed by a general offensive. Despite the valiant efforts of the Boer soldiers, they couldn't resist the impetus, and were forced back to the city center. There, they found many defensive positions sabotaged by ANC partisans, which eventually forced the commander to surrender.\n\nWith the fall of Johanasburg, the Boers have lost not only their largest settlement, but also their only developed industrial sector, effectively crippling their war production: this will make much more difficult for them to keep fighting effectively, and many agree that this might be the beginning of the end for this ill-fated uprising."

 USA.saf.war.missions.6.t:0 "The Second Battle of Johanasburg"
 USA.saf.war.missions.6.desc:0 "In a sudden shift for a war that is already uncertain enough, Johanasburg has been retaken by the army of the Boer Republic. In the days before the offensive, American aerial reconnaissance had already shown a large concentration of Boer and German forces near the front, but few would have expected such a fierce counterattack: due in large part to supplies and advisors from the Afrika-Schild, the insurgents proved to be much more organized and effective than before, and achieved several key victories, forcing the front back to the city, where the occupation garrison had already bunkered in, supported by several volunteers from the African National Congress.\n\nDespite their fortifications and air support, the defenders couldn't resist the attack, supported by several battalions of superiorly-trained German troops, and gradually conceded more and more ground, before finally opting to fully withdraw from the city. While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency. As the front moves once more towards the core lands of the South African Federation, many believe that the war is slowly turning in favour of the German coalition."

 USA.saf.war.missions.7.t:0 "The Invasion of Libreville"
 USA.saf.war.missions.7.desc:0 "Perhaps the Zentralafrikan High Command believed themselves too far from the frontline to be targeted by any real offensive, or perhaps they were simply too ill-prepared to actually do anything about it. The order of the addends doesn't change the result: in what comes as a surprise for most, and as a horrible nightmare for the Afrika-Schild, Libreville, the largest port of the westernmost Reichskommissariat, and the main source for their supplies from the mainland Reich and has fallen to American and South African marines.\n\nWith the cover of darkness, and supported by several naval units "borrowed" from the US Navy to their ally, the joint OFN task force launched a large naval invasion against this vital infrastructure. As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline. Should the Schild fail to retake Libreville, not only would the flow of supplies from the motherland abruptly end, but it would be the start of a devastating pincer move which could theoretically cause a general collapse of the German colonial alliance."

 USA.saf.war.missions.8.t:0 "The Route at Libreville"
 USA.saf.war.missions.8.desc:0 "To many, the capture of Libreville, and the opening of a second front deep inside Africa, had appeared as the last nail in the Schild's coffin, but the tides have turned once again in this strange, bloody war. It seems the concrete risk of total defeat awakened the German Reichskommissariaten from their torpor: frantic call for arms were emitted, emergency reserves called into service, and the efficient German production plants, fuelled by the death throes of so many unfortunate souls, churned out an endless supply of weapons at the price of thousands more lives in a clean, mathematical proportion. Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands. As the Afrika-Schild draws a collective breath of relief from the averted catastrophe, and the American government faces heavy criticism at home for the hundreds of soldiers dead or captured in what newspapers have called "the Bay of Fools", all contenders return their undivided attention to the main front. It seems the war will last longer than expected."

 USA.saf.war.missions.9.t:0 "The Fall of Leopoldville"
 USA.saf.war.missions.9.desc:0 "The blow was heavy, and the dagger was plunged deep. After a startling string of defeats suffered by the Afrika-Schild, Leopoldville, the administrative center of Reichskommissariat, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. This news comes as a welcomed development for the South Africans and their allies, as it now means that a second front has been successfully established deep inside Deutsch-Afrika, crippling the German war effort and dramatically sinking their morale.\n\nThe city, now bordering the Congo Lake, was poorly fortified, but had strong natural defenses in the form of quagmires and the ever-present jungle, which slowed down the attackers, and severely limited the use of artillery and air support. In the end, however, they weren't necessary: the hastily-erected defences fell after only a short battle as the mercenary garrison preferred to surrender in the face of the dramatic numerical superiority of the enemy. Now, they await to know their fate as it is unclear whether they are actual soldiers or "armed civilians".\n\nWith the fall of Leopoldville, Zentralafrika is on the brink of collapse, and the entire Schild hangs precariously in the balance: unless bold actions are taken, and victory follows, the war will be lost. Which is exactly what their opponents hope. Perhaps, the war is truly coming to an end this time"

 USA.saf.war.missions.10.t:0 "The Siege of Leopoldville"
 USA.saf.war.missions.10.desc:0 "After the fall of Leopoldville, most thought the war would end in a matter of weeks, if not days, with the total collapse of the Afrika-Schild, but it seems they will remain disappointed. In a last, desperate move to cauterize the wound on the western front, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte mobilized all remaining forces for a desperate push: Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller himself returned from the southern front to lead the assault on his administrative center. Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound. It will take much more than a postcard victory to revert the tides of battle."

 USA.saf.war.missions.11.t:0 "The Quelimane Uprising"
 USA.saf.war.missions.11.desc:0 "After a string of defeats suffered by the numerically inferior Ostafrikan colonial forces, today the easternmost African Reichskommissariat, and de facto leader of the Afrika-Schild, was forced to take an even worse humiliation, as American forces entered Quelimane, the colony's administrative center and seat of power of Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig.\n\nThe city had been turned into a veritable stronghold, with a ring of bunkers, trenches, minefields and underground tunnels covering the entire perimeter in a hellish maze of interlocking firing zones. What the garrison couldn't expect, however, was an enemy from the inside: though it's unknown whether they took contact with the besieging army, or if they acted on their own, partisan movements all throughout the city's many concentration camps and slave quarters launched a full-scale uprising, slaughtering their jailers and breaking free, spreading chaos and panic in the German quarters of the city. This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nQuelimane was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last. Reichskommissar Hüttig managed to flee the city, and has sworn to avenge the defeat "with the lives of all Amerikaner in the city", but some doubt the factibility of such a claim."

 USA.saf.war.missions.12.t:0 "The Rape of Quelimane"
 USA.saf.war.missions.12.desc:0 "Everyone expected Hans Hüttig to try his best to keep faith to his promise of revenge. After all, he was known for his vengeful temper long before taking his office in the Dark Continent. What few predicted, however, was the extent of such single-minded will: the Reichskommissar immediately launched a furious counteroffensive, until the front fell back to the occupied Quelimane. What followed was one of the greatest tragedies to befall this bloodied land.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had showed only minimal troop movements near the city, and the garrison believed they could hold out in the hastily-repaired German defences: this belief soon turned hollow, as the attackers made use of an unmarked web of tunnels, known only to the highest officers, to secretly enter the city at night. Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises. The worst, however, came after the victory, as all non-Germans within the city were declared "traitors to the Aryan race": the soldiers simply entered camps, tents, houses and began killing. With bullets. With bayonets. With flamethrowers The few who managed to escape told of SS covered from head to toe in human gore, rummaging through the bullet-ridden bodies of men, women and children to find the few still breathing and finish them with knives. This will surely have an impact upon the OFN coalition"

 USA.saf.war.missions.13.t:0 "The Battle of Salisbury"
 USA.saf.war.missions.13.desc:0 "Today, the war enters a new phase, as the front has definitely shifted in favor of the OFN coalition. Salisbury, the largest settlement of the former British colony of Rhodesia, now part of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. The city was an important industrial center in the area, and home to the command staff for that sector, therefore its capture is an important success against the Afrika-Schild.\n\nThe city had been well-prepared for the siege, with strong defenses and large ammunition supplies, but in the end, the enemy was too strong. One by one, the bunkers were busted by surgical artillery and aerial strikes and tanks moved in to seize the entrenched defenders still fighting. Slowly, the garrison fell inwards to pre-prepared positions, but they found many of them sabotaged or occupied by partisan who had been waiting for the right moment to strike: many German soldiers were felled by surprise bursts of their own HMG, and the rest were crushed between the anvil and the hammer as the South African infantry launched the final offensive.\n\nReichskommissar Hans Hüttig is reportedly "disappointed" by the failure to defend the city, and has issued a conscription order to mobilize additional forces and retake the city as soon as possible. He also threatened the occupying forces to abandon the city immediately, "or suffer the consequences of their hybris". Despite his boisterous claim, all observers agree that this is an important victory for the OFN."

 USA.saf.war.missions.14.desc:0 "One of the reasons many fear Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig is that he remembers everything. Every slight, every insult, every defeat, every humiliation: he stores them inside, and waits for the moment he can enact his revenge. When Salisbury first fell in the hands of the joint American-South African force, he swore that they would pay for their insolence: now, it seems he has come to collect his debt as the last offensive managed to push deep enough to retake the city.\n\nSalisbury had been prepared for the assault, with new fortifications built in place of the demolished German ones, but it proved no match for the intense incendiary and bunker-busting bombings which targeted the defenses for days. When the Schild launched a full-scale offensive, few were still capable of fighting, and even retreating to more defensible positions in the center proved useless, but when the garrison commander finally surrendered, he was shocked to hear the terms. With the only other alternative being mass execution, they were requested to enact decimation: one every ten soldiers would be selected by chance under German surveillance, and killed by his own comrades. The entire process, intended to break enemy morale, was described in detail by a few prisoners liberated on purpose and allowed to return to their units.\n\nThe American high command was shocked by the news, but even more shocking was the tale of what the native population was subjected to: hundreds of suspected partisans, along with even more slaves who had "dared" to leave their camps and go live in houses left empty by evacuated German families, were summarily executed by firing squads, their corpses thrown into mass graves.

 USA.saf.war.missions.15.t:0 "The Fall of East London"
 USA.saf.war.missions.15.desc:0 "Despite the increasing involvement of the United States, it seems the scales are tipping in German favor. Today, the Afrika-Schild managed to fully occupy the city of East London: after a string of defeats suffered by the OFN coalition in the East, the Boer insurgent army, supported by several elements of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, had pushed the frontline far enough to threaten the core of the South African Federation. Despite losing its status of an economic center due to the years of apartheid, which saw most of its white population leaving for greener pastures, the city was still an important logistical junction, allowing supplies from Cape Town and the increasingly frequent American shipments to directly reach the eastern front.\n\nThe city had been heavily fortified for the coming assault, with several artillery and anti-aircraft emplacements scattered in the many squares and parks dotting the city, while the outskirts had been torn down and replaced with interlocking bunkers, trenches and minefields. Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets. The garrison fought back valiantly, with important support from those civilians who preferred to fight and die rather than live in slavery, but in the end they were forced to concede more and more ground, until a last defensive line was hurriedly formed around the harbour: all possible supplies were loaded on any availabe ship to not let it fall in German hand, but many were left behind and had to surrender and face the war prisoners' camps.\n\nThe American commander in South Africa has vowed to "free the people from the national socialist yoke", and already rumors are starting to circulate about heavier investments in the war, but this defeat is drawing heavy criticism for how the American expedition was ill-prepared for this conflict, and many doubt that the tides of war will change. Is this the end for freedom in Africa?"

 USA.saf.war.missions.16.t:0 "The Recapture of East London"
 USA.saf.war.missions.16.desc:0 "Perhaps the fall of East London finally let the South Africans and their American allies understand the seriousness of the situation. They say that, in desperate times, people do extraordinary things, and this proved true once more, as a full-scale counterattack, ordered by the joint General Staff of the coalition, managed to liberate the city after a hard-fought battle: the arrival of new reinforcements from the United States proved instrumental in retaking the city, showing once more how invested they are in the war, something which drew diplomatic protests from the mainland Reich.\n\nThe Germans had bunkered in the city, erecting makeshift fortifications and turning the outskirts into a death zone with booby-traps and minefields: uncaring for the civilian population, they had torn down several blocks to have clear firing lines and dig trenches. In the end, however, this wasn't enough, and the heavy bombardments destroyed most outer defenses, forcing the garrison to fall back to the opposite end of the city, where they had already prepared for the retreat. Under the cover of darkness, most of the Germans and high-ranking Boer officers abandoned the city, leaving behind only a token force to delude their enemies into thinking they were still fighting. The ruse was discovered only the next day, when the Americans attacked and found almost no resistance.\n\nEven though the victory was less of a triumph than hoped for, this still comes as a success for the OFN coalition after a long time without any meaningful success. While it is clear in Washington that the war will still drag on, at least total defeat is no longer a likely outcome, which is already a result."

 USA.saf.war.missions.17.t:0 "The Fall of Cape Town"
 USA.saf.war.missions.17.desc:0 "Today, a devastating blow has been struck against South Africa as Cape Town, the Federation's capital and largest city, fell to a joint task force of Boer and Südwestafrikaner soldiers. The last weeks had seen the American-led coalition suffer defeat after defeat, losing several key settlements to the Afrika-Schild, until the front reached the very heart of the country. Now, that heart has stopped beating.\n\nThe hills surrounding the "City Bowl" were turned into fortresses linked by trench lines, fully enclosing the Cape in a ring of heavy fortifications. The city itself had extensively prepared for the coming attack, with barricades and key locations garrisoned by volunteer units, and American artillery and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the roads and squares. However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid. The South African government, evacuated from the city before the attack, has promised to retake the city, but is this still possible?"

 USA.saf.war.missions.18.t:0 "The Second Battle of Cape Town"
 USA.saf.war.missions.18.desc:0 "Perhaps the war isn't over yet, and there's still some fighting spirit in the South African Federation. In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies. At this point, no one knows whether this will be the proverbial swansong before ultimate defeat, or the beginning of the comeback for the Federation."
