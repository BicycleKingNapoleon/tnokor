### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ABBA_KOVNER_DESC:0 "Thirteen times dead and thirteen times returned. A legend. A specter. A devil and an angel to thousands. All of these things are said of Abba Kovner, everywhere in Europe. His name is murmured from the fearful mouths of innocents and the guilty alike, from Brest to Moscowien.\n\nAbba Kovner was once a rather smalltime rebel in Vilna, and was the first to identify the German desire to commit murder upon all of his kind. Throughout the war he tried and failed to halt the German war machine from the inside and avenge his murdered people alongside his United Partisan Organization, their numbers dwindling as time turned against them.\n\nThis was in the past however, and his plans have failed. The Nazis marched on, and as the reprisals grew ever crueler and harsher, so too did Kovner. While once his name might have been known as that of a hero, it is now one hushed in fear by both Germans and the natives they rule over.\n\nRumored an unkillable demon by Ostland locals, Kovner has always returned to haunt the Germans and those who serve them, Kovner growing the UPO from a small partisan organization into a personal army to commit terror on those he perceives as his enemies. The UPO grew first by destroying the rival LLS and EP partisan groups. Afterwards, Kovner became one of the first partisans to begin filling his ranks with former slaves and concentration camp survivors, rescuing hundreds in several large assaults on camps and trainlines. With numbers bolstered, Kovner's name reached international ears for the first time with his January 8th hospital bombings, killing over a hundred Germans-including those in the hospital's maternity ward-in retaliation for the discovery of a mass grave of over three hundred Jewish women and children near Raseiniai. Since then, the number of deaths attributed to Kovner and his group have grown to the thousands.\n\nNow, Kovner has launched his final plan. Total revenge for the terrors inflicted on his people and others by the German scum. Six million Germans are to die, no matter the cost. For history has its unpaid deaths, and is it truly better if they just forget?"
POLITICS_FRANZ_STAHLECKER_DESC:0 "Former commander of the SS in Ostland, Stahlecker dutifully rescinded his membership in the organization during their near coup during the West Russian War, showing true bravery and loyalty to the Reich. For this, he was awarded the position of personal secretary to Reichskommissar Hinrich Lohse, and has proven both his astute mind, fair hand, and loyalty to his leader and his Reich. If a model German ever existed, look upon he, for he is one to aspire to.\n\nMany would ask where, exactly, Stahlecker first entered the German eye. He proved his loyalty in the war, where he led the extermination of those deemed inferior across Ostland and purged record numbers. No leader seemed as ready to commit to the plan as Stahlecker, who actively encouraged pogroms and personally organized the SS to commit to their work.\n\nWith such a reputation, and such loyalty to the Reich, it is no surprise that Stahlecker is an avowed Bormannite. While Stahlecker has expressed frustration with the slave system in the past, unhappy that the untermensch are allowed the right to even work under the Reich, he has otherwise expressed his desire to see the Nazi system continue as it has forever, for a thousand years, both in public and out. Staunchly refusing to allow change to destroy what he sees as the greatest creation of man, Stahlecker is firmly determined on continuing the policies that have made Germany the greatest nation on earth.\n\nSurely Stahlecker is a man to believe in. What empire will stand the test of time if not for the Reich? And what makes a man if not his willingness to just follow orders?"
POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_JECKELN_DESC:0 "Barbarity and brutality. The marks of a bandit and a brigand, and the true qualities that define a good man of the SS.\n\nWhat better qualities for an SS officer? Nothing! Steadfastly loyal to Burgundy, and more than willing to do anything to further both his own power and that of Heinrich Himmler, Jeckeln has become infamous in Ostland.\n\nA longtime enemy of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler, Jeckeln has become increasingly dissatisfied with both the civilian and military sectors of the government as he has continuously argued for integration of the SS into Ostland's security forces. While he has done this as the head of the SS, however, claiming to simply be a patriot wishing to use the Reich's best military forces to its advantage, his men have painted a different picture.\n\nConstant skirmishes with the garrison, assassinations, terrorism, and all the while still commiting themselves to reaving their way across those few untermensch who still live openly. The SS has become Ostland's biggest and only legal terrorist organization, a mirror of their brothers in the Reich. Their plans seemingly incomprehensible to the rest of Ostland, the only thing truly known about their motives is that they are those of Heinrich Himmler.\n\nBut why is Jeckeln so loyal? So willing to torch it all? Nobody knows for sure, but some can guess. It is no secret that men desire power, and Jeckeln's eyes are firmly on the homeland. While his desires are not truly known, what is known is his bitter falling out with Reinhard Heydrich, and his ambitions to take the position held by his inferiors."
POLITICS_OTTO_DRECHSLER_DESC:0 "Doctor Otto-Heinrich Drechsler lost his leg in the Great War, the first one, many years ago. And yet, his fighting spirit has never left him.\n\nLoud and proud, Drechsler is the type of man to fight until the bitter end or until anyone else offers the most minimum of resistance. This is a bit ironic, as representing the militarist faction of Ostland he has often been looked upon for the fiery and pig headed rhetoric that so many Göringites possess, but Drechsler seems unwilling to hold such a mantle.\n\nAny criticism of this has made the man even more resolute in his attempts to appear as such though, which has only made the matter worse. It has become a popular joke in Ostland's administration to describe men as 'Drechslers', a type of person quick to rise in anger yet who never finds the bravery to fight and runs at the first instance. In otherwords, Drechsler's name has become synonymous with coward.\n\nIntent to disprove those he sees as morons and completely and utter morons, Drechsler plans to wage a great campaign to retake first Ostland and then those parts of the Reich that have slipped from its grip. To this end, he had already advocated for such actions as an intervention into Moskowien to wipe out native settlements of Russians that Reichskommissar Kasche had seemingly missed, and an outright invasion of Poland to depose Hans Frank and permanently end the Polish resistance, which Drechsler had been laughed out of a room for claiming was secretly still massive and poised to strike at the Reich.\n\nWith all supervision gone, one just has to wonder where Drechsler's plans will even begin, or where they might end."
POLITICS_ANDREAS_MEYER_LANDRUT_DESC:0 "Born into money, Meyer-Landrut is a man with the mind and acumen to succeed in an economic system built to collapse. The representatives of the combined business, industrial, and production might of Germany's crown colony, many say Meyer-Landrut is the true reason for the colony's success.\n\nThis might make him loved in the Reich, but everything about him has led to him being one of the Nazi party's most hated men.\n\nFascinated by Slavistics and Eastern European history since he was a boy, Meyer-Landrut's fascination for the untermensch grew into genuine respect and care during his tours of his factories, where he began to speak firsthand with many of the slaves and servants who worked under him. Overtime his voice on the matter has grown louder, in proportion with his power over Ostland's industries, and now he has loudly begun to advocate for the dawning of a new era in the east. One of peace and understanding, where German and Slav both can be given the gift of democracy and freedom. Inspired by Speer, him and the growing movement of Ostland liberals and student protesters have become possibly the Nazi's greatest threat in Ostland.\n\nMany would accuse him of being an idealist, of being a fool, and of being doomed to the firing line. Meyer-Landrut seems to care little, however, and has so far avoided all accusations of treason. Even when the SS accused him of using his wealth to falsify passports for Jewish families, even when the garrison accused him of using his railines to evacuate Slavs to Romania, even when a Meyer-Landrut cargo plane destined for the Americas was found packed with untermensch children and their mothers. Each time the accusation has slid off of him like water on glass.\n\nNow, Meyer-Landrut says, is the moment where Germans must prove themselves to the world. Will they risk living as monsters, or are they willing die as humans?"
POLITICS_MICHAL_VITUSKA:0 "It is difficult to say anything accurate about Vituska. The man seemingly holds no political views, no loyalties (besides those he constantly claims for the Reich and the Belarussian people, which is doubtful on both counts), and no aims. He is a man who has been accused of a thousand things, yet he has always managed to deftly avoid any actual suspicion by pure luck and coincidence. With so little to say about the man besides the utter lack of things to say, it may be better to list some of the events that led to his odd rise to power.\n\n-Post War, sudden unsuspected and well planned partisan uprisings across Belarus nearly overthrow local German rule. Before Wehrmacht units can even respond, the Black Cats under Vituska miraculously find and destroy the main partisan bases. He is quickly offered a position on the Belarussian Central Council.\n-Early 50s, the President of the BCC, Radaslau Astrouski, is killed in a car accident. The man who hits him later commits suicide in prison. A vote is held with Vituska as one of four nominees for the position. Two of them are soon revealed by an unknown source to have been commiting treason, and are shot. The third drops out of the race soon after.\n-Two Years Later, after an explosion rocks the Central Council building, killing several opponents of Vituska, the Council is disbanded. Vituska however continues his duties, and soon finds the perpetrators as well as a group of black market arms dealers, all of whom die in the ensuing gunfight. The Council is soon allowed to reform, with Vituska as its permanent head.\n-West Russian War, the chaos in West Russia leads to mass panic in Ostland. Vituska agrees to oversee Belarus so that the garrison can be moved east. A record thirteen different previously unknown Soviet partisan cells are then found and destroyed. When General von Gottberg accuses Vituska of forming and arming these cells, his unit quickly gets into a shooting war with local SS units under vague circumstances. Von Gottberg escapes, before his vehicle is shot at, drives off a bridge, and is later found at the bottom of a lake. Later investigation finds the car had also been doused in gasoline."
POLITICS_HINRICH_LOHSE_DESC:0 "If one was to take a look at all the Reichskommissariats of Germany, they would not find an impressive sight. Most of the Reichskommissariats are falling apart at the seams, disloyal to the Reich, or simply unprofitable hellholes. However, one among these squabbling puppets stands out as a true jewel of Germany. Reichskommissariat Ostland is a mostly calm, profitable, and somewhat Germanized state, and it was all because of one man: Hinrich Lohse. A veteran of the Great War, an early devotee to the Party, and High President of Schleswig-Holstein, it was no surprise when Lohse was appointed to the job as Reichskommissar. From there, he managed Ostland loosely, delegating much of the necessary work to his most loyal and competent subordinates. This strategy has borne much fruit, as Ostland is one of the most Germanized, most profitable, and most stable Reichskommissariats. As long as these men had Lohse to control them and act as figurehead, this system worked.\n\nHowever, bad health gets the best of everyone, and over the last few years Lohse has slipped away from the spotlight more and more. With him goes his uniting presence, and those under him have understood this. With Lohse's already loose hand growing more and more limp, those subordinates who once served loyally now begin to eye Lohse's seat with a growing hunger.\n\nAs Drechsler, Stahlecker, and Meyer-Landrut bicker with one another, Kovner's attacks grow more and more bold, and Vituska and Jeckeln watch and plot behind closed doors, one can see the clear cracks in the system. The people of Ostland can only hope that either Lohse recovers or a compromise candidate is selected as his replacement, lest chaos and blood flow through the streets of Riga."
