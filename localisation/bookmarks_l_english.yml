 THENEWORDER_NAME:0 "신질서"
 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "유럽에 새로운 질서가 펼쳐졌습니다. 1930년대 부상한 독일이 이후 10년간 적들을 격파하면서 세계는 영원히, 그리고 돌이킬 수 없는 수준으로 변화해 왔습니다. 세계 국경이 다시 그려졌고 과거의 제국들은 자아도취한 승자의 군홧발 밑에 짓밟혀 재가 되어 버렸습니다. 독일인이 달에 착륙하고, 암살자가 히틀러를 공격하며, 런던에서 폭탄이 터지고, 일본은 중국에서 새로운 급진적인 경제 계획을 실시합니다."
 SAF_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A monarchy without a monarch and a nation without direction, the Union of South Africa has found itself increasingly struggling to hold back the forces of unrest waiting to tear the nation asunder.\n\nWhile the Boers have never managed to take power in the nation, their presence is felt as more and more they clamor for either representation or outright independence. Elsewhere, the Africans shout from the streets against a nation of segregation, if not in law than in practice. If its domestic issues were not enough, South Africa finds itself torn between two spheres, constantly being pressured by the Americans to join the OFN and the Germans to bow to the Reich."
 ANG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The pilots of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika rule the skies even while Africa remains locked in chaos. From the airstrips of Angola, hundreds of German bombers filter in and out en-route to bomb West Africa into the dust. From his squadron headquarters, Reichskommissar Schenck rules, treating the natives with a light hand and his duties even more lightly, many have criticized his hands off attitude and seeming unwillingness to actually rule the nation.\n\nTo Schenck, however, only the skies can provide him solace from the hell that he had a hand in creating, and some whisper that the Reichskommissar is not entirely loyal to the Reich, but from all reports, Schenck remains as loyal as he has ever been, a model hero of German aviation."
 MZB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Some say that each Reichskommissariat is but a mirror of its ruler. Indeed, Ostafrika is very similar to Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig: both are dry, pitiless and utterly devoid of humanity.\nUnder the watchful eye of their Aryan masters, the inferiors toil, their blood, their tears and their deaths nothing but the perfect fuel for the Reich. Even the watchers, however, are under scrutiny: Hüttig despises incompetence and pity, and will crush anyone displaying said defects. What awaits his enemies is a lifetime of suffering, where even death is a luxury.\nIn a world of degenerates and traitors, Hans Hüttig will uphold the Aryan standard, no matter the odds, no matter the means, no matter the price."
 COG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Covered by a lush jungle and filled with wildlife that would make all hunters weep in joy, the former Belgian Congo is the richest of all the German colonies. Under the perfect façade, however, lies a dangerous world, far more dangerous than any safari may be.\nReichskommissar Siegfried Müller spends his days hunting, neglecting the administration, and the entire colony has been turned into a private business for the many corporations, both German and foreign, lusting after Zentralafrika's resources.\nHowever, despite being a seasoned hunter, Müller might find himself prey to far larger predators: there are dangers lurking in the jungles, and sometimes, ink and paper can cause more slaughter and suffering than any set of fangs."
