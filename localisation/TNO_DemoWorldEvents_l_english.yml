Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."

When Ulrike Meinhof and her Red Army Faction seized power from Speer's liberals, the chaos and destruction that followed on her conquest of the Reich brought devastation and a taste to the RAF's revolutionary policies for Germany. On the steps of the Reichstag, Meinhof addressed the assembled crowd with a speech decrying Nazism and the wretched institution it sustained. \n\nIt is there that the new chairwoman declared the formation of a united Deutsche Sozialistische Republik, a Marxist utopia aiming to equalize all citizens of the Reich.

Bennett utilized his acceptance speech to call on a bitterly divided America to join together as one nation to face down the struggles of the day.\n\nMild-mannered and averse to political extremes, Bennett believes that a middle ground between both sides of the civil rights debate is possible.

In his victory speech, Johnson praised the continuing endurance of his party, and vowed to carry on the good work of his predecessors.\n\nBullish but progressively-minded, Johnson shares the conviction of former President Kennedy towards the cause of civil rights. Insider voices claim he has some sort of grand project in the works, aimed at improving numerous areas of American society, but Johnson remains tight-lipped for the time being.

With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria.

Stahlecker claims that the continued improvement of the economic and industrial sectors, as well as a focus on rebuilding the colony from the Civil War.\n\nObservers have pointed out that the policies of the last regime are the only thing that allowed such violence, and that a strict copying of what was done before will most likely be ineffectual when facing the Herculean task of mending together the colony.

The story says that the partisans would run around burning cities they had recently conquered, calling for 'any who dreamed of freedom! Any good German who had fought their government in secret! Those who have put up posters, hidden radios, and yearned for a better world!' to come out and join them.

With Oberst Rolf Steiner signing for the German forces, and General Creighton Abrams signing for the forces of the OFN, the development of the war into a bitter and costly stalemate has forced a return to the pre-war borders.\n\nWith the border unchanged and a terrible loss of lives on both sides, the controversy of the war appears solidified in history as many now ask whether the war was truly worth it. Now as the Boer people reintegrate into South Africa, many within the OFN now fear that the last beacon of democracy in Africa will swiftly return to its pre-war troubles whilst German Africa faces an uncertain future now that the Schild's gamble to secure Africa has failed."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.74.desc:0 "For the first time since the war in the 1950s, West Russia is united under one banner. Unfortunately for the country and the world, that banner is the swastika. The first transmissions and declarations coming from the region talk about the cryptic Aryan Brotherhood, a society of Russians who believe that being Aryan is not based on race, but is a state the Slavic race can achieve, thus becoming equal to their conquerors.\n\nAs insane and unlikely as this sounds, the Brotherhood under the rule of one Gutrum Vagner is now in control of West Russia. They have announced their success and their equality to the "Reykh". The world looks silently in awe and confusion, as they wait for what happens next. What will be the future moves of this new Russian warlord state, and what will be the reaction of the mighty Reich to this absurd entity?"

A safe haven for political radicals from all sides of the spectrum, the Republic became increasingly unstable, but in the end, the status quo held. The [NIK.GetRulingParty], party that has led the republic since its infancy, have managed to eliminate their various shades of radical opposition, and ensured that West Russia is united once again.\n\nA declaration written by the President has been released, stating that Komi has been replaced by the West Russian Free Republic, which is not limited in the territory it used to hold as an ASSR, but encompasses much more. This has proven to be a turning point, and marks the final defeat of the rivals to the democratic warlord state in the region. It now seems that a new contender for the control of Russia has appeared.\n"

While the approval from noble émigrés has been nearly unanimous, others have denounced the Emperor's government as a restoration of tyranny. The major powers, meanwhile, remain silent on the issue, waiting to see what happens next before making any diplomatic overtures.\n\nDespite its successes, Vyatka's government still only controls roughly a third of Russia.

The threats to the regime are few and small, with most experts on Russian affairs agreeing that a force equal to the old socialist republic has arisen. However, the dictatorship's leader, [TOB.GetLeader], has refrained from making correlations with the WSPR, preferring to portray his regime as a new one."

Promising a return to a pre-war quality of life, Yazov enjoys great popularity, and his military reforms suggest a strong emphasis on the reunification of Russia.

DEMOWORLDEVENT.86.desc:0 "Sporadic news reports and announcements coming from Central Siberia have confirmed that the region has fallen under the control of a previously obscure entity known as the Siberian Black Army. Based on the teachings of Nestor Makhno from the days of the Russian Civil War, a society following militarized anarchism was formed, where the population was not protected by the state, but by local militia and their commanders that were to protect the communes and their anarchist system.\n\nThis ideology, first adopted in the lands between the Central Siberian Republic and Genrikh Yagoda's Supreme Soviet as both governments collapsed, has now been asserted over the entirety of the CSR's former territory by the use of armed force by this new Black Army, despite all the challenges that such a system has introduced."

Despite all the challenges it has faced due to the rival government of Mengjiang occupying much of Mongolia, the socialist state has looked elsewhere to expand to, specifically the rest of Central Siberia.\n\nThe Council has defeated its formidable enemies in the region, and has now claimed the entirety of it in the name of the "new Soviet Union" they seek to establish. Elsewhere in Russia, rival warlords spectate, either with admiration or concern, this new challenger for national dominance."

The state of Novosibirsk, led by Alexander Pokryshkin, has had a turbulent history. The rival government was formed as a violent backlash to measures taken during the Siberian War, and maintained an uneasy coexistence with the city state of Barnaul.\n\nSoon, though, it managed to overcome its political challenges by utilizing its large population, agricultural base and industry, and turned to the expansion and reunification of Central Siberia. This has obviously succeeded, as its last enemies have been defeated, and Pokryshkin now rules as a benevolent despot of the region."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.89.t:0 "Kemerovo Unifies Central Siberia!"

The former Soviet general had sided with the fledgling Central Siberian Republic, before defecting during the Siberian War, establishing his own clique and giving himself the title of Supreme Ruler, Autocrat and King of Rus, Rurik II, after the medieval prince that founded the Rurikid dynasty.\n\nThis unusual identity he has assumed has now become well-known in Russia and abroad, as his Kingdom has wrestled control over wide swaths of land. Other nations look with awe at this new and absurd faction, that now has a shot at Russian reunification."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.90.t:0 "Tomsk Unifies Central Siberia!"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.90.desc:0 "In the reign of chaos that is typical for the Russian warlord states a beacon of freedom and democracy may have appeared. The old government of the Central Siberian Republic, forced to retreat to the city of Tomsk after its collapse, has recently issued an announcement declaring that the region is now back under one state, their own.\n\nLittle is known about the political factions that once dominated this republic's politics, but it appears that the group known as the Humanists has secured its government. Founded by well-known composer Dmitri Shostakovich and continued by his protégé Mieczysław Weinberg, it is a group of artists that wishes for a humane and democratic republic which protects its citizens. That exact dream has apparently been achieved."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.91.desc:0 "In a strange turn of events, the windswept taiga of the Russian Far East is now reportedly under the control of the forces of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, longtime leader of the Russian Fascist Party. While the idea of Russians embracing fascism may seem bizarre, many analysts point to the RFP's key role in the All-Russian Expeditionary Force as a precedent. Some have already proclaimed this little more than the Force reasserting it's authority.\n\nWhat comes next for Rodzaevsky's regime is uncertain. Logically the RFP will probably begin a push into Siberia proper in an effort to unify Russia. How this clique will interact with the international system is uncertain. Although the RFP and Rodzaevsky have long enjoyed the patronage of Japanese backers, his vision of a fascist Russia is clearly more in-line with the German model, considering his party's virulent anti-Semitism and usage of Nazi iconography.

However, the recent development caused it appear in headlines for the first time since 50s. After holding on to his domain of Irkutsk for a long time, Yagoda managed to destroy other contenders for the Russian rule in the region, once again reasserting his dominance in the outskirts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nWith his close enemies eliminated, Chairman Yagoda now seeks to fully reinforce his claim as a legitimate successor of Bukharin's state and expand his power to the western frontiers of Siberia. The apparent rebirth of the Soviet successor state became a source of alarm for its Siberian neighbors while the international community looks forward to the future of Russia with a great concern.\n"

Popular amongst the youth and the dreamers of Siberia, one must nevertheless wonder just how dedicated Sablin, barely an adult, is to his dream of a truly equal Union. Whatever the case, the men and women of the Far East march west, determined to bring their ideas to all of Russia."

It is widely theorized that Tsar Mikhail was was used as a puppet for other reactionary generals and remains one, but that remains uncertain.

A frontier long abandoned by any national authority for decades, a new contender for power now arises there, perhaps against all odds. Mikhail Matkovsky, the leader of the rebellious branch of the Russian Fascist Party based in the port city of Magadan, has established himself as the premier authority in the Far Eastern region.\n\nA pragmatic fascist of some repute, Matkovsky and his allies first split from the original party in Amur due to the Rodzaevsky's excesses and support for the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War. Now the rest of the world waits with bated breath to see how much further this old Russian fascist can go.

He announced that Vice President John F. Kennedy would be sworn in as his replacement, praising Kennedy's character and describing him as a "unifier". He went on to extoll the successes of his presidency, in both foreign and domestic policy.\n\nProgressives have praised Kennedy's record on civil rights, and members of the NPP and R-Ds alike have expressed their support of Nixon's resigning. Segregationists, however, are skeptical, fearing that Kennedy would continue to advance a pro-civil rights agenda."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.145.a:0 "Maybe President Kennedy will heal the nation."

POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "John Fitzgerald Kennedy's path to political prominence was one overshadowed by others' controversies. Scion of the powerful Kennedy family and son of President Joseph Kennedy, John found himself recalled from the Pacific front after his elder brother Joseph Jr.'s death, and had been groomed to follow in his father's steps ever since. In the years following the 1948 election and the implosion of the Democratic Party, the Kennedys (with the exception of John's brother Robert) loyally followed the shattered remnants of the party to the GOP, becoming members of the Republican-Democrat Party. Some predicted that John's career would be tainted by the failures of Kennedy the Elder's administration, but John's personal charisma and political savvy were enough to help him grow out of his father's shadow. In 1960, he was on the Republican-Democrats' victorious Vice Presidential ticket. Unfortunately, his running mate was Richard Nixon.\n\nNow, John finds himself thrust into leadership of a nation in turmoil, one that desperately looks toward him for guidance. But for every American who sees him as a beacon of stability, there is one who sees him as an obstacle: ardent segregationists fear that his idealism will lead to him furthering civil rights legislation, and committed progressives scorn him for not being as impassioned as his brother Robert. Fate has ordained John F. Kennedy be the one to steer the ship of state, but will he be the one to guide it out of dangerous waters?"

The Iberian Caudillos have hence announced that to support their effort to stabilise and further unite their new union they would establish an advisory council of state officials whose sole job it shall be to advise on matters of state.\n\nTheir direct influence on policy should be negligible, yet in reality analysts have predicted that the council could be used by either Caudillo to gain an upper hand on any political disagreement between the two. Consequently its been deemed that the council may act counterintuitively in further dividing the two nations instead of uniting them.

In order to preserve their ability to govern, they have had to delegate some of their powers to a separate - but very clearly lower - council, consisting of appointed officials.

DEMOWORLDEVENT.98.desc:0 "Shocking scenes have emerged from the growing crisis in the Iberian Peninsula as uncontrollable political violence threatens to spread across the nation. Catalonia has seen some of the worst fighting between political dissidents and government forces, who have been clashing day and night in the region's capital. In scenes eerily reminiscent of Spanish Civil War, barricades were manned once gain and neighbour was put against neighbour as ideological leanings took over the lives of Barcelona's residents.\n\nFor the moment, the radical leftist trade union known as the CNT-FAI and its sympathisers have wrestled control of Barcelona and are now set for a bloody prolonged struggle against the counter-attack of pro-government forces. It's a tale as old as time itself for Spain, as the nation plays out the bloody, tumultuous years of the 30's once more."
